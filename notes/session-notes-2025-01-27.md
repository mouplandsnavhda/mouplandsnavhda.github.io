# Session Notes - 2025-01-27

## 📝 Summary
- Implemented security improvements based on the security audit recommendations
- Added security headers to all HTML files that were missing them
- Fixed external link security by adding `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to target="_blank" links
- Verified that all HTTP links have been updated to HTTPS

## 🔄 Changes Made

### Security Headers Added
Added the following security headers to files that were missing them:
- `404.html` - Added Content Security Policy, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, and X-XSS-Protection headers
- `bird-vendors.html` - Added all security headers
- `payment-success.html` - Added all security headers and fixed malformed HTML comment
- `test/index.html` - Added all security headers
- `analysis/index.html` - Added all security headers

### External Link Security
Added `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to target="_blank" links in:
- `payment.html` - New Member Form link
- `test/index.html` - Facebook and NAVHDA National links
- `bird-vendors.html` - Facebook and NAVHDA National links
- `404.html` - Facebook and NAVHDA National links

### Files Already Compliant
The following files already had proper security headers:
- `index.html`
- `bird-orders.html`
- `pay.html`
- `payment.html`

## 🗂️ Files Modified
- `404.html`: Added security headers
- `bird-vendors.html`: Added security headers and fixed external link security
- `payment-success.html`: Added security headers and fixed malformed HTML comment
- `test/index.html`: Added security headers and fixed external link security
- `analysis/index.html`: Added security headers
- `payment.html`: Fixed external link security

## 🧠 Decisions/Context
- Followed the security audit recommendations to implement Phase 1 fixes
- Used consistent security header format across all files
- Skipped `retrieve/index.html` as it appears to be a Google Docs export, not a standard HTML page
- Verified that all HTTP links have been previously updated to HTTPS

## 🚧 Next Steps / TODOs
- Consider implementing Phase 2 security improvements (comprehensive CSP, JavaScript security)
- Monitor for any new security vulnerabilities
- Continue regular security audits as recommended
